## Introduction

You can be a rookie or an experienced developer, either way, managing your server through the terminal can be difficult or time consuming.

CyberPanel is a lightweight yet powerful server management tool that gets its power from the LiteSpeed Web Server. In fact, it uses OpenLiteSpeed, the open source distribution of LiteSpeed Web Server, as a web server and supports protocols/engines such as HTTP2 and QUIC by default. One of the biggest strengths of LiteSpeed is a cleverly designed cache system (LSCache) for HTTP queries.

**Requirements**

It is preferable to start with a clean and newly installed system. Make sure the system meets the requirements for installing CyberPanel:

+ Centos 7.x, Centos 8.x, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04
+ 1GB or above RAM
+ 10GB Disk Space

## Step 1 - Updating the System

When you set up a new server, system components such as programs and kernels are usually not available at the latest. Let's update all components and system on the server, enter the following commands sequentially.

**CentOS**

```bash
sudo yum upgrade
```

**Ubuntu**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
```

## Step 2 - Running the CyberPanel Installer

Run the code below:

```bash
sh <(curl https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh || wget -O - https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh)
```

### Step 3 - Choosing the Configuration during Setup

+ When prompted to choose between OpenLiteSpeed and LiteSpeed Enterprise, you should choose OpenLiteSpeed (1), the other option is not free.
+ If you need a DNS server, mail server and FTP server, answer yes to the full installation question.

Your panel login information will be shown to you at the end of the installation.

## Conclusion

Congratulations, you now have a powerful web server.

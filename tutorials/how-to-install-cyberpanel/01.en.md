## Introduction
You can be a rookie or an experienced developer, either way, managing your server through the terminal can be difficult or time consuming.
I think the most interesting feature of Cyberpanel is that it uses Open LiteSpeed, the open source distribution of Litespeed Web Server, 
as a web server and supports protocols/engines such as HTTP2 and QUIC by default. One of the biggest strengths of Litespeed is a cleverly designed cache system(LSCache) for HTTP queries.

**Used Components**
+ Open Lite Speed
+ MariaDB + MySQL + PostgreSQL
+ Dovecot + Postfix
+ ModSecurity + Fail2Ban
+ OpenDKIM + One Click SSL + Docker + Git

## Step 1 - Preparation
It is preferable to start with a clean and newly installed system, first let's see if we meet the requirements for installing cyberpanel.

**Requirements**
+ Centos 7.x, Centos 8.x, Ubuntu 18.04, Ubuntu 20.04
+ 1GB or above Ram.
+ 10GB Disk Space.

## Step 2 - Installion
### Step 2.1 - System update
When you set up a new server, system components such as programs and kernels are usually not available at the latest. Let's update all components and system on the server, enter the following commands sequentially.

**CentOS**
```bash
sudo yum upgrade
sudo yum update
```

**Ubuntu**
```bash
sudo apt-get upgrade
sudo apt-get update
```

### Step 2.2 - Running the CyberPanel Installer
Run the code below
```bash
sh <(curl https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh || wget -O - https://cyberpanel.net/install.sh)
```

Then you should answer what the setup program asks you by entering the relevant numbers on your keyboard, since the CyberPanel Installer is updated frequently, I will not write these steps here in great detail, instead I will explain what the answers you give in important points mean.


### Step 2.2 - Configuration during setup
+ When prompted to choose between Open LiteSpeed and Litespeed Enterprise, you should choose Open LiteSpeed (1), the other option is not free.
+ If you need a DNS server, mail server and FTP server, answer yes to the full installion question.

## Finnaly
Your panel login information will be notified to you at the end of the installation. Congratulations, you now have a powerful web server, you can redirect your domains by adjusting your nameserver settings.
